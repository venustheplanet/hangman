# Hangman
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 

For milestone 2: Create the variables for game
Task 1: Define list of possible words
1. print list of fruits
Task 2: Choose a random word from list using random module
2. select random fruit
Task 3: Ask user for an alphabet input
3. ask user to input an alphabet
Task 4: Check if input is a valid single alphabet character
4. check if input is valid

For milestone 3:
Create 2 functions, check_guess and ask_for_input functions which contain the code for those two things.
function 'ask_for_input':
- does step 3 - 4 in milestone 2
- Additionally convert the letter to lowercase
- Call the function Check 'check_guess' that checks the guess of the word is in the letter or not

function 'check_guess':
The check_guess function will take the guessed letter as an argument and check if the letter is in the word.
